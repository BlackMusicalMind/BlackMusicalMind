- 👋 Hi, I’m Chris
- 👀 I’m interested in music and music technology. I'm here with the intentions of learning everything I can about coding, programming, and web-development of music software and applications. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning UX Design and Front End development. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any and everything that I can that will strengthen my knowledge of programming and navigating the music industry as it pertains to technology (and vice-versa).
- 📫 You can reach me by messaging me here or reaching out to me directly via email at Blackmusicalmind@gmail or HalisiSoulproductions@gmail.com
